Final HMS 520 Project - Assessing indicators of air quality in several national parks over time

Project Proposal: 
   Team members: Kelly Compton
   Format: 3. Analyzing a dataset that uses data wrangling and modeling tools in R
   Overall goal of the project: to use data visualization and wrangling tools in R to create visual plots of various metrics relevant to air quality in several national parks in the US Mountain West and US West Coast over time
   Detailed plan and timelines: 
      I will download data from this website: https://ard-request.air-resource.com/data.aspx - which has recorded air quality measurements related to indicators such as pollution, temperature, and ozone every hour of every day for the past several decades. I will load this data into a dataframe in R Studio and use data wrangling and visualization tools to assess summary metrics of this information over time and generate comparisons between the different national parks. I plan to finalize the details once I actually dive more into the data, but preliminarily, I am to focus on the following: 
      - National Parks: Canyonlands, Death Valley, Denali, Glacier, Joshua Tree, Lassen Volcanic, Mount Rainier, and Yosemite National Parks 
      - Parameters: Ambient temperature, Ozone, Particulate Matter 2.5, Solar Radiation, and Vector Wind Speed
      - Time period: 01/01/2015 - 10/31/2021 (last date of available data); 01/01/2019 - 10/31/2021
